# Thenium


Thenium is a platform that leverages the power of blockchain and NFTs to create and manage documents within communities. It enables NFT owners to create, edit, and vote on content, fostering collaboration and decision-making. Users can earn token rewards for participating in the process. The platform is built on a smart contract called DocumentManager.

## Features of Thenium:

NFT-based communities: Thenium allows the creation of unique communities based on NFT contracts. Each community can have its own set of documents managed by NFT owners.

Document creation and editing: NFT owners can create new documents and propose changes or branches to existing documents. This fosters collaborative content creation and editing.

Voting system: Thenium incorporates a voting mechanism that allows NFT owners to express their opinion on document branches or child documents. This helps in reaching a consensus on the content of documents within the community.

Token rewards: Participants can earn token rewards for their involvement in the voting process. This incentivizes users to actively participate and contribute to the community.

Document treasury: Each document has its own treasury, which accumulates tokens as rewards for participants. NFT owners can claim their share of tokens from the treasury.

## Use cases for the average person:

Collaborative content creation: Thenium can be used by groups of people who own a specific set of NFTs to collaboratively create and manage content, such as articles, guidelines, or educational materials.

Decision-making: Communities can leverage Thenium's voting system to make decisions on proposed changes or additions to documents, ensuring a democratic process.

Incentivized participation: The token reward system encourages users to actively engage with the platform and contribute to the community, creating a more dynamic and valuable ecosystem.

NFT-based projects: Projects or organizations built around NFTs can use Thenium to manage their content and involve their community members in the decision-making process.
